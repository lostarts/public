                    <h2 class="section-heading">How It Began</h2>
                    <p class="headline">December 2001. A sheet of veneered plywood balanced across two 2x4s in my in-laws' backyard. A circular saw I didn't know how to use. Three turntables and a record collection that needed a home. I made the first cut and ruined it.</p>
                    <p>Blaming improper tools, inadequate space and lack of experience, I threw my hands up. The scraps sitting dormant at my in-laws for decades. Yet, my issue was something else entirely.</p>
                    <p>What was missing was people. Community. Folks to lean on with more skill & experience than I had in that moment.</p>
                    <p>Maybe you've been there too. Standing before a project — a chair, a website, a song, a prototype or painting. You know what you want it to become. You don't know how to get there. You have the tools, space and inspiration. What you're missing are the conversations. The "what if you tried this" from someone who's been where you are. That one piece of advice that unsticks everything.</p>
                    <p class="poetic-break">We've mastered showing finished work. The polished portfolio shot, perfectly lit. The launch post. The case study with clean outcomes.</p>
                    <p class="headline">We've lost the messy parts.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, Lost Arts is about embracing the mess and seeing it through.</p>
                    <p>That space where we help each other sort through the mess. The conversation when someone walks by your workbench. The half-built thing that sparks an idea for someone else. The "try this instead" from sharing space with others. That's where the real work happens.</p>
                    <p>My work has long focused on supporting independent creativity. I built websites for musicians. Launched Subsystence to shine light on unknown artists. I co-founded Kickstarter to communally fund creativity. Lost Arts is about what comes before. The messy bits. The unsure, scared, pushing you out of our routine bits. When you need company.</p>
                    <p>It's the community I needed in that backyard. Share the rough draft. The failed attempt. The thing that doesn't work yet. Ask the obvious question. Receive critical critique. Find people who get excited about your mess because they're in the middle of their own.</p>
                    <p class="poetic-break">The truth is simple: making things is easier around other people who make things.</p>
                    <p class="headline">Lost Arts is a portal from your studio to others. See what they're making. Ask questions. Show what you're making. Exchange process and technique, not portfolio shots.</p>
                    <p>We're starting with 100 members. We want people who are actively making things and want to help each other get better.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis-text">If you're working on something and you'd value having makers in your corner, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
