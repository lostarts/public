                    <h2 class="section-heading">How It Began</h2>
                    <p class="headline">December 2001. A sheet of veneered plywood balanced across 2x4s in my in-laws' backyard. A circular saw I didn't know how to use. Three turntables and a record collection that needed a home. I made the first cut and ruined it.</p>
                    <p>At first, the problem seemed obvious. Bad tools. No proper workspace. Zero experience. But that wasn't it.</p>
                    <p>What was missing was people. Community. Folks with more experience who could guide me.</p>
                    <p>Life has a way of separating makers from each other. You move. You change careers. You go independent. Suddenly the people you used to work alongside aren't around anymore.</p>                    </p>
                    <p>Maybe you've been there too. Standing before a project—a chair, a website, a song, a prototype. You know what you want it to become. You don't know how to get there. You have the tools, space and inspiration. What you're missing are the conversations. The "what if you tried this" from someone who's been where you are. That one piece of advice that unsticks everything.</p>
                    <p>Lost Arts exists for this—for studio culture and the messy middle. For the journey from idea to finished work.</p>
                    <p>It's the community I needed in that backyard. A place to share rough drafts and failed attempts. To ask obvious questions and get real feedback. To find people excited about your mess because they're in the middle of their own.</p>
                    <p>The truth is simple: making things is easier around other people who make things.</p>
                    <p class="headline">Lost Arts is a portal from your studio to others. See what they're making. Ask questions. Show what you're making. Exchange process and technique, not portfolio shots.</p>
                    <p>We're starting with 100 members. We want people who are actively making things and want to help each other get better.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis-text">If you're working on something and you'd value having makers in your corner, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
