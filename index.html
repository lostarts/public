                    <p class="headline">December 2001. A sheet of veneered plywood balanced across 2x4s in my in-laws' backyard. A circular saw I didn't know how to use. Three turntables and a record collection that needed a home. I made the first cut and ruined it.</p>
                    <p>At first, the problem seemed obvious. The wrong tools. Inadequate workspace. Not enough experience. But that wasn't the real problem.</p>
                    <p>What was missing was people. Community. Folks with more experience who could guide me and catch my mistakes. A mentor. A group of peers.</p>
                    <p>Life has a way of separating artists, makers and other creatives from each other. You move. You change careers. You go freelance. Suddenly the people you used to work alongside aren't around anymore.</p>
                    <p>Maybe you've been there too. Standing before a project‚Äîa chair, a website, a song, a prototype. You know what you want it to become. You don't know how to get there. You have the tools, space and inspiration. What you're missing are the conversations. The "what if you tried this" from someone who's been where you are. That one piece of advice that unsticks everything.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading section-heading-spaced">Where It's Headed</h2>
                    <p class="headline">Lost Arts exists for this very reason ‚Äî for studio culture and the messy middle. For the journey from idea to finished work.</p>
                    <p>It's the community I needed in that backyard. A place to share rough drafts and failed attempts. To ask obvious questions and get real feedback. To find people excited about your mess because they're in the middle of their own.</p>
                    <p>The truth is simple: making things is easier around other people who make things.</p>

                        <p>My name is Charles Adler. For much of my career I've been tinkering with ways to accelerate the creative potential of others which eventually led to co-founding Kickstarter in 2009. Lost Arts began in 2015 as a one-month experiment within an abandoned meat packing plant in Chicago's West Loop. It grew into a 20,000 square foot space on Goose Island where makers built everything from AI-powered urban farms to public art installations to bread ovens. What we learned in those rooms‚Äîabout community, feedback, and the value of shared space‚Äîshapes everything we're building now. It's a circuitous story, and one worth telling. <a href="#" class="text-link">Read the full history ‚Üí</a></p>
