                    <p class="headline">December 2001. A sheet of veneered plywood balanced across two sawhorses in my in-laws' suburban Chicago backyard. A circular saw that I barely knew how to use. Three turntables and a record collection that needed a proper home. I made the first cut and immediately knew I'd ruined my plans for a turntable stand...</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">For a while, I blamed the obvious things—not having the right tools, appropriate space, or experience with woodworking. But that wasn't really it.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">What I didn't have was someone to call. Someone who'd built something similar and could tell me where I'd gone wrong before I made the cut. Someone who'd look at my sketch and say, "Here's what's going to happen when you try that." YouTube tutorials would have helped, but not entirely. I needed a conversation with someone who had the experience I lacked, someone who could correct my mistakes and guide me along the way.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">Maybe you've been there too. Standing in front of a project—a chair, a website, a song, a prototype—knowing exactly what you want it to become but not quite how to get there. You have tools. You have inspiration. What's missing is that studio culture. That moment when someone glances over at your workbench and offers the one insight that unsticks everything.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">We've built a world that's very good at showing finished work. The portfolio shot with perfect lighting. The launch post. The case study with clean outcomes. But we've lost something in the process—those messy in-between spaces where makers help each other figure things out.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">The conversations that happen when you're working near someone else who's also figuring it out. The half-built prototype that sparks an idea for someone else's project. The "what if you tried this" that comes from someone who's been exactly where you are.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">That's what Lost Arts is.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">It's the community I needed in that backyard twenty-three years ago. A place to share the rough draft, the failed attempt, the thing that doesn't quite work yet. To ask the question that feels obvious but isn't. To find people who get genuinely excited about your mess because they're in the middle of their own.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">Share a photo of your work in progress. Add some context. Get feedback from people who've been there. That's it.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">We're starting with 100 members—not to be exclusive, but to be intentional. A community like this works when it's made of people actively making things and genuinely helping each other get better. And here's the thing: we're still figuring out Lost Arts too. Part of being in this first group means you'll help shape what this becomes. We're in the early, messy days of bridging the gap from early version to complete vision, and we need makers who understand that process.</p>
                    <p class="fade-text">If you're working on something—anything—and you'd value having a group of makers in your corner, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
