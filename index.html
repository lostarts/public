            <p>December 2001. A sheet of veneered plywood balanced across two sawhorses in my in-laws' backyard. A circular saw in my hands that I barely knew how to hold. Three turntables and a record collection that needed a proper home. I made the first cut and immediately knew I'd ruined it.</p>

            <p>For a while, I blamed the obvious things—I didn't have the right tools, I didn't have a proper workshop, I didn't have enough experience. But that wasn't really it.</p>
            <p>What I didn't have was someone to call. Someone who'd built something similar and could tell me where I'd gone wrong before I made the cut. Someone who'd look at my sketch and say, "Here's what's going to happen when you try that." I didn't need a YouTube tutorial. I needed a conversation.</p>
            <p>Maybe you've been there too. Standing in front of a project—a chair, a website, a song, a prototype—knowing exactly what you want it to become but not quite how to get there. You have tools. You have inspiration. What you're missing is the workshop culture. That moment when someone glances over at your workbench and offers the one insight that unsticks everything.</p>
            <p>We've built a world that's very good at showing finished work. The portfolio shot with perfect lighting. The launch post. The case study with clean outcomes. But we've lost something in the process—those messy in-between spaces where makers help other makers figure things out.</p>
            <p>The conversations that happen when you're working near someone else who's also figuring it out. The half-built prototype that sparks an idea for someone else's project. The "what if you tried this" that comes from someone who's been exactly where you are.</p>
            <p>That's what Lost Arts is.</p>
            <p>Supporting independent creatives has been the thread through most of my work—from co-founding Kickstarter to now. But where Kickstarter helped people launch finished ideas, Lost Arts is about the earlier, messier part of the process. The part where you're still figuring it out and could use some company.</p>
            <p>It's the community I needed in that backyard twenty-three years ago. A place where you can share the rough draft, the failed attempt, the thing that doesn't quite work yet. Where you can ask the question that feels obvious but isn't. Where you can find people who get genuinely excited about your mess because they're in the middle of their own.</p>
            <p>It's built around a simple truth: making things is easier when you're around other people who make things. Not networking. Not personal branding. Just sharing what you're working on, getting real feedback, and connecting with people who understand the gap between vision and execution because they live in that gap too.</p>
            <p>Post a photo of your work in progress. Add some context—what you're trying to do, where you're stuck, what questions you have. Decide if you want to share it privately with specific people or with the wider community. Get the kind of feedback that only comes from people who've been there.</p>
            <p>We're starting with 100 members. Not because we want to be exclusive, but because we want to be intentional. A community like this only works if it's made up of people who are actively making things and genuinely want to help each other get better.</p>
            <p>If you're working on something—anything—and you'd value having a group of makers in your corner, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
